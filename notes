The acronym CRUD refers to all of the major functions that are implemented in relational database applications. Each letter in the acronym can map to a standard SQL statement, HTTP method or DDS operation:
Operation			SQL		HTTP	DDS
Create				INSERT	PUT / POST	write
Read (Retrieve)		SELECT	GET	read / take
Update (Modify)		UPDATE	PUT / PATCH	write
Delete (Destroy)	DELETE	DELETE	dispose


- Submit data via traditional forms with full page refresh
- Submit data via REST API(AJAX HTTP requests) without page refresh
	-backbone.js, angular, ember

Under the hood, all front end frameworks use jQuery's ajax() method, so we will be using REST API end points via jQuery ajax() method 

########## Main folders in express.js

node_modules: dependencies, express.js and connect libraries
views: jade files
routes: Node.js modules that contain request handlers
db: seed data and scripts from mongo
public: html, css, javascript

├── db
├── public
│   ├── css
│   ├── img
│   └── js
├── routes
└── views
    └── includes

    After this we will add the project metadata with NPM

    NPM is a registry and a dependency managment tool

################### package.json ##################
    npm init vs type or copy the file and npm install

    npm install express --save

    Advise to deal with dependencies, commit your node_modules folter along with the code to a git repository
    and use that instead of fetching modules according to packaje.json each time on deployment.

################# app.js #######################

main file
typical structure:

1. require dependencies
2. configure settings
3. connect to database(optional)
4. define middleware
5.define routes
6.start the server
7.start workes with clusters(optional)

The order here is important becuase requests travel from top to bottom in the chain of middleware


3.one of the ways to configure Express.js settings is to use app.set() with the name of the setting and the value



4.middleware is the backbone of express, comes in 2 flavours:
external modules as bodyParse.json from connect/express -- > app.use(bodyParser.json())
defined in the app or its modules such as app.use(function(req, res, next) {...});

middleware is nothing more than a function with three parameters: request, response, and next.

5.routes are processed in the order they are defined:

the way routes are defined in express.js is with helpers app.verb(url,fn1,fn2) where fnjs are request handlers, uverb balues are all, get, post, put, del
delete

single route catches requests of all methods on all URLs
app.all('*', function(req, res) {
	
})

res.render(viewName, data, callback(error, html)) -- > express 

6. instructions to start the server
http.createServer(app).listen(app.get('port') function() {})
